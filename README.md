AIM	: Predictive analysis of House Price using House Features in a locality using Machine Learning.
	: ( House price prediction.)
Author	: predict11

# Introduction
It very Hard to predict the price of the house for machine
problem can be solved using the Neural Network


# Keywords 
Keywords : Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Satastics, DNN, Numpy, Pandas.

## Tools
PreRequirements :

		 LIBRARIES 	: Pandas,Numpy, Sklearn, Keras, TensorFlow, matplotlib, csv.
		 IDE 		: spyder


Abstraact 	: we have studied the data manipulation libraries such as Numpy and Pandas for handling the huge dataset of House Data.
		  using matplot library we can visualise all the implimented modules.
		  Using sk-learn we can import test-train split method which divides the whole data into test and train cases.
		  Using keras we can build the DNN model with Sequential layers.
		  TensorFlow is an alternative library which allows to create ML model using Estemators and Tensors.




# procedure to run
Procedure : 

	1). Exctraction :
		Dataset is exctrated from kaggle
	2). Preporcessing
		Run the preprocessing.py file to preprocess the downloaded data.
	3). Model Training
		Run the models.py file to fit data to model.
		While the model if trained program is under exicution and after complition apply the prediction steps.
	4). prediction
		To predict the best price of house put the data tupule in test Pred_test cases.
		Output is shown in single floating point Number as a Price of house


## Evaluation Plan
Optimisation is on the way stay tuned...
